Ahnaf Kazi
Battleship
Will be based on named pipes and networking.
Server will handle storage and calculation of boards after ships are placed.
Clients will be able to input a coordinate into the terminal in order to select the space to launch at. (Possibly able to select with readline arrows)
The server will tell the client if it hit.
The server will store the board, but will still send a string with a version of the boards for the client side players to see.
A semaphore will make sure there are only 2 clients connected.

Expected Completion:
Board initialization and modification: 1/7
Server Client handshake: 1/11
Networking: 1/14
